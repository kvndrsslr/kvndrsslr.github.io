I am a [Ph.D. student](https://dice-research.org/KevinDreßler) at the [DICE research group](https://dice-research.org) @[Paderborn University](https://upb.de).
My current research within the [SFB901](https://sfb901.uni-paderborn.de) is targeted towards automatic generation of QA systems.
I am also interested in Semantic Web technologies and writing great code.
